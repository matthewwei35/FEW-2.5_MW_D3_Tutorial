## D3 Loaders

D3 has its data loaders built-in. D3 works with JSON, CSV, and a few other data types. Read more [here](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#fetches-d3-fetch).

You're probably familiar with JSON let's take a look at CSV. CSV stands for Comma, Separated, Values. 

Here is a sample CSV file: 

```
"name","population","country","x","y"
"San Francisco",874961,"USA",122,-37
"Fresno",525010,"USA",119,-36
"Lahore",11126285,"Pakistan",74,31
"Karachi",14910352,"Pakistan",67,24
"Rome",4342212,"Italy",12,41
"Naples",967069,"Italy",14,40
"Rio",6748000,"Brazil",-43,-22
"Sao Paolo",12300000,"Brazil",-46,-23
```

Each line is one record. 

Take a look at the first row, the first row is special: 

```
"name","population","country","x","y"
```

This row defines the fields for all of the other rows. Each field is separated by a comma. The first line names the values in each of the following rows. 

The same data in JSON format would be longer but also can have nested values. CSV is flat. There is just one level of data stored. 

CSV is more compact than JSON it takes fewer characters to store its contents. 

## Loading Data

D3 has a couple of different loaders built-in. You can use these to easily load data from JSON or CSV. 

Load a JSON Object:

```JS
d3.json('metal.json')
  .then(json => console.log(json))
```

Load a CSV object.

```JS
// CSV
d3.csv('metal_bands_2017.csv')
  .then(csv => console.log(csv))
```

Notice that both of these use a Promise! In other words: `d3.json()` and `d3.csv()` both return a promise.

A Promise is an object used by JS to handle async tasks. let's break the examples above into steps: 

```JS
d3.json('titanic-passengers.json')
  .then(json => console.log(json))
```

What happened here? You called `d3.json('titanic-passengers.json')` which returned a Promise. A Promise is an object something like: `{...}`. Let's put it in a variable: 


```JS
const p = d3.json('titanic-passengers.json')
p.then(json => console.log(json))
```

Here you put the promise in the variable `p` and then call the `.then()` method. The `.then()` takes a callback function which is executed when the promise resolves. In this example, the promise will resolve when the JSON data is loaded. 

The `then()` callback receives the data you are loading. 

`d3.json().then(data => ...)`

## Getting started

To get started with this example create a new HTML file and add your boilerplate code: 

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

  <svg id="svg" width="500" height="500"></svg>

  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    // Your Script here...
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Find the data folder in this repo and copy the `cities.csv` file into the directory with the HTML you just created. 

### Load cities.csv

Add the following to your page: 

```JS
d3.csv('cities.csv')
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data)
  })
```

Load your page to the browser and check the console. You should see something like: 

```
[Log] Array (8) (index-loading.html, line 16)
0 {label: "San Francisco", population: "874961", country: "USA", x: "122", y: "-37"}
1 {label: "Fresno", population: "525010", country: "USA", x: "119", y: "-36"}
2 {label: "Lahore", population: "11126285", country: "Pakistan", x: "74", y: "31"}
3 {label: "Karachi", population: "14910352", country: "Pakistan", x: "67", y: "24"}
4 {label: "Rome", population: "4342212", country: "Italy", x: "12", y: "41"}
5 {label: "Naples", population: "967069", country: "Italy", x: "14", y: "40"}
6 {label: "Rio", population: "6748000", country: "Brazil", x: "-43", y: "-22"}
7 {label: "Sao Paolo", population: "12300000", country: "Brazil", x: "-46", y: "-23"}

Array Prototype
```

What happened here? You loaded the cities.csv with D3 and D3 converted this into an array of objects. 

This will be our data! 

Add the D3 boilerplate code. 

**Challenge!**

Try adding the boilerplate code from memory. 

Your goal is to target the SVG tag and draw some circles. 

The Boilerplate code will go inside the Promise callback since it needs to access the data that shows up there. 

```JS
d3.csv('cities.csv')
  .then(data => {
    // console.log(data)
    d3.select('#svg')
      .style('border', '1px solid')
      .selectAll('circle')
      .data(data)
      .enter()
      .append('circle')
```

We will cover more sophisticated methods to handle some of the issues here for now let's try and tackle the Cities data with the things that we already know. 

The Cities data contains an x and y field which is the geocoordinate latitude and longitude of the city. These numbers range from x of 122 (San Francisco) to -46 (Sao Paolo), and y of -37 (San Francisco) to 74 (Lahore). 

If we use these values to position our shapes in the SVG document we need to place them in the coordinate space of 0 to 500. The width and height of the SVG element are 500. 

Try this: 

```JS
d3.select('#svg')
  .style('border', '1px solid')
  // select all <circle>s in #svg
  .selectAll('circle')
  .data(data)
  .enter()
  .append('circle')
  .attr('cx', d => parseFloat(d.x) * 2 + 250)
  .attr('cy', d => parseFloat(d.y) * 2 + 250)
  .attr('r', 20)
  .attr('fill', `red`)
  .attr('opacity', 0.25)
```

NOTE! I had to `parseFloat(d.x)` since the values from the CSV file are imported as strings!

I scaled and offset the values. This places the 0,0 coordinate in the center of the document. 

Let's set the size of the circles based on the populations. These population numbers are really big some are in millions! We need to scale these values. 

Try this: 

```JS
.attr('r', d => parseInt(d.population) * 0.00001)
```

You can try different numbers here and see what happens. 

Let's set the color based on the country. There are four countries represented: USA, Pakistan, Italy, and Brazil. 

```JS
.attr('fill', d => {
  if (d.country === 'USA') {
    return 'cornflowerblue'
  } else if (d.country === 'Pakistan') {
    return 'gold'
  } else if (d.country === 'Italy') {
    return 'green'
  } else if (d.country === 'Brazil') {
    return 'tomato'
  }
})
```

Should look like this so far: 

![example-1.png](images/example-1.png)

Wow, San Francisco and Fresno are pretty small compared to those other cities! 

Note! The areas represented by the circle's radius do not accurately represent the population since the area of a circle is Ï€r^2. Where our drawing represents the diameter of the population. 

NOTE! to scale and position our elements we need to know the max values and minimum values represented in our data. 

NOTE! Setting the color for each country was a little awkward. 

While we could solve these problems on our own, you did this earlier in class, D3 is a library that was built to solve these problems! It has all of the tools we need to handle these problems.
